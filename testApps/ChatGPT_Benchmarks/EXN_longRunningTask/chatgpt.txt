Give me a non-trivial example of an Android application that blocks the UI thread with a long running task.

A non-trivial example of an Android application that blocks the UI thread with a long-running task could involve performing complex data processing or a heavy initialization task directly in the onCreate method of an Activity. Such operations are common in applications that deal with large datasets, complex UI initialization, or intensive computation at startup. Blocking the UI thread can lead to an "Application Not Responding" (ANR) dialog, as the system considers the application unresponsive if it does not process input events within 5 seconds or so.
Example: Complex Data Processing on UI Thread

Consider an application that needs to load and process a large dataset from a local database or file system when it starts. Instead of doing this operation in a background thread, doing it on the UI thread will block user interaction and render the application unresponsive until the task completes.
MainActivity.java

java

package com.example.blockinguitask;

import android.os.Bundle;
import android.widget.TextView;
import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    private TextView textView;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        textView = findViewById(R.id.textView);

        // Simulate a long-running data processing task on the UI thread
        processData();
    }

    private void processData() {
        // Simulate loading a large dataset (e.g., from a database or file)
        List<String> largeDataSet = loadLargeDataSet();

        // Simulate processing the dataset (e.g., filtering, sorting, complex calculations)
        for (int i = 0; i < largeDataSet.size(); i++) {
            // Simulate complex processing by sleeping the thread
            try {
                Thread.sleep(10); // This sleep is just to simulate long processing
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }

        // Update the UI after processing
        textView.setText("Data processed successfully!");
    }

    // Mock method to simulate loading data
    private List<String> loadLargeDataSet() {
        List<String> dataSet = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
            dataSet.add("Item " + i);
        }
        return dataSet;
    }
}

Explanation

    MainActivity: On creation, it calls processData, which simulates loading and processing a large dataset synchronously on the UI thread.
    processData: This method simulates a long-running operation by loading a large dataset and then "processing" it with a simulated delay (using Thread.sleep(10) in a loop).

Why It's Problematic

    Blocking the UI Thread: Performing long-running tasks directly in onCreate or any method running on the UI thread freezes the UI, preventing user interaction and possibly triggering an ANR if the operation takes too long.
    Poor User Experience: Blocking the UI thread leads to a poor user experience, as the application appears frozen and unresponsive to input.

Solution

To avoid blocking the UI thread:

    Use Background Threads: Perform long-running operations in a background thread, AsyncTask, or use modern approaches like Kotlin Coroutines or RxJava for complex operations.
    AsyncTaskLoader or ViewModel with LiveData: For data loading operations, use AsyncTaskLoader or architecture components like ViewModel with LiveData to manage data loading in a lifecycle-aware manner, allowing for asynchronous operations without blocking the UI thread.

Modernizing the data processing and UI update mechanism to utilize background threads or asynchronous tasks is crucial for maintaining a responsive application and enhancing user experience.
