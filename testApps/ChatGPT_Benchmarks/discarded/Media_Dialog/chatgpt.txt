To fulfill your request, we will outline an example of how to create a simple Android application that utilizes ExoPlayer to play media and shows an AlertDialog while the media is playing, which will be dismissed upon completion of the media playback. This example assumes you have a basic understanding of Android development and are familiar with Kotlin.
Step 1: Add ExoPlayer Dependency

First, ensure you have ExoPlayer added to your project's build.gradle file:

groovy

dependencies {
    implementation 'com.google.android.exoplayer:exoplayer:2.X.X' // Use the latest version
}

Step 2: Implement ExoPlayer in Your Activity

In your activity, initialize ExoPlayer, prepare it with a media source, and set up a listener to know when the playback is complete.

kotlin

import android.net.Uri
import android.os.Bundle
import androidx.appcompat.app.AlertDialog
import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity
import com.google.android.exoplayer2.ExoPlayer
import com.google.android.exoplayer2.MediaItem
import com.google.android.exoplayer2.Player

class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    private lateinit var player: ExoPlayer
    private lateinit var alertDialog: AlertDialog

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)

        // Initialize player
        player = ExoPlayer.Builder(this).build()

        // Prepare media item
        val mediaItem = MediaItem.fromUri(Uri.parse("Your Media URL Here"))
        player.setMediaItem(mediaItem)
        player.prepare()

        // Show AlertDialog
        showAlertDialog()

        // Listen for playback completion
        player.addListener(object : Player.Listener {
            override fun onPlaybackStateChanged(state: Int) {
                if (state == Player.STATE_ENDED) {
                    // Dismiss AlertDialog
                    alertDialog.dismiss()
                }
            }
        })

        // Start playback
        player.play()
    }

    private fun showAlertDialog() {
        alertDialog = AlertDialog.Builder(this)
            .setTitle("Playback in Progress")
            .setMessage("Media is currently playing.")
            .setPositiveButton("OK", null)
            .create()
        alertDialog.show()
    }

    override fun onDestroy() {
        super.onDestroy()
        player.release() // Don't forget to release the player
    }
}

Explanation

    ExoPlayer Initialization: We initialize ExoPlayer and prepare it with a media source, which is the URL of the media you want to play. Replace "Your Media URL Here" with the actual URL of your media.

    AlertDialog Display: An AlertDialog is displayed using the showAlertDialog method, which is called right before we start the media playback. This dialog provides a simple message to the user indicating that playback is in progress.

    Playback Completion Listener: We add a listener to the ExoPlayer to monitor changes in playback state. When the playback state changes to Player.STATE_ENDED, indicating that the media has finished playing, the AlertDialog is dismissed.

    Release Resources: In the onDestroy method of the activity, we release the ExoPlayer resources. This is an important step to avoid leaking resources.

This example provides a basic implementation. Depending on your application's requirements, you might need to handle other states, such as buffering or error states, and adjust the user interface accordingly.

notes: this one does not actually have a bug.  exoplayer stops when the activity dies
