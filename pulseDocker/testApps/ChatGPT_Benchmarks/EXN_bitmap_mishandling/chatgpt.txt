Give me a non-trivial example of an android application that does not handle bitmaps correctly.

Handling bitmaps incorrectly is a common source of memory issues in Android applications, often leading to OutOfMemoryError. This can happen when an application loads large bitmaps into memory without proper resizing or management, especially when displaying multiple large images in a list or grid.
Non-Trivial Example: Gallery App

Consider a gallery app that displays a grid of images loaded from the device's storage. If these images are not processed correctly before being displayed, especially in terms of resizing and compression, the app can quickly run out of memory when scrolling through the gallery.
MainActivity.java

java

package com.example.galleryapp;

import android.os.Bundle;
import android.widget.GridView;
import android.widget.ImageView;
import android.content.Context;
import android.view.View;
import android.view.ViewGroup;
import android.widget.BaseAdapter;
import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity;

public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    private Integer[] imageIDs = {
        R.drawable.image1, R.drawable.image2, R.drawable.image3,
        R.drawable.image4, R.drawable.image5, // Assume these are large bitmap resources
    };

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        GridView gridView = findViewById(R.id.gridView);
        gridView.setAdapter(new ImageAdapter(this));
    }

    public class ImageAdapter extends BaseAdapter {
        private Context context;

        public ImageAdapter(Context c) {
            context = c;
        }

        public int getCount() {
            return imageIDs.length;
        }

        public Object getItem(int position) {
            return position;
        }

        public long getItemId(int position) {
            return position;
        }

        // Create a new ImageView for each item referenced by the Adapter
        public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent) {
            ImageView imageView;
            if (convertView == null) {
                imageView = new ImageView(context);
                imageView.setLayoutParams(new ViewGroup.LayoutParams(350, 350));
                imageView.setScaleType(ImageView.ScaleType.CENTER_CROP);
            } else {
                imageView = (ImageView) convertView;
            }

            imageView.setImageResource(imageIDs[position]); // Loading the full-sized image
            return imageView;
        }
    }
}

activity_main.xml

xml

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<GridView xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:id="@+id/gridView"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    android:numColumns="auto_fit"
    android:columnWidth="100dp"
    android:stretchMode="columnWidth"
    android:gravity="center"/>

Explanation

    MainActivity: Sets up a GridView to display images.
    ImageAdapter: A custom adapter that populates the GridView with images. It creates an ImageView for each item but loads the full-sized image resource directly without considering the size of the ImageView or the screen.

Issues

    Memory Overuse: By loading full-sized images directly into ImageViews that are much smaller than the original image size, the application uses significantly more memory than necessary. This can quickly lead to OutOfMemoryError, especially when scrolling through many images.
    Lack of Bitmap Optimization: The app does not use any form of bitmap optimization like resizing or caching, which are crucial for efficiently handling large sets of images.

Solution

To handle bitmaps correctly and avoid OutOfMemoryError, you should:

    Resize Images: Before setting them to an ImageView, resize the images to fit the required dimensions. This can significantly reduce memory usage.
    Use Bitmap Options: BitmapFactory.Options can be used to decode images with proper scaling.
    Implement Caching: Use an image loading library like Glide or Picasso that handles image loading, resizing, and caching efficiently, reducing the complexity of your code and improving performance.

Handling bitmaps correctly is crucial for performance and memory management in Android applications, especially those dealing with large sets of images.
